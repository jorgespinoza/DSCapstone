This repository includes all I learned from the Data Science specialization course by IBM.

The file named Capstone Project_Accident Severity.rar includes the introduction/business problem and all the coding corresponding to the Data Science Capstone Project - Car Accident Severity in notebook format. The one in format .py just includes the coding lines.

Also the file "Data_Collisions.rar" includes the Seattle Accident Database used in this project.

Feel free to contact me if I you need help to understand some part of the project.
